## Project Overview  
This project offers a full ML pipeline: from data ingestion and preprocessing, through model training and validation, to deployment-ready artifact generation.  
It’s designed to be modular, extensible, and reproducible.

## Features  
- Data handling & preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training (using frameworks such as CatBoost)  
- Model evaluation & logging  
- Artifact generation (trained model files, logs, etc.)  
- Notebook support for exploratory analysis
